# JavaScript Project (Course-Based)

## Overview

This project was built as part of a JavaScript course by **Jonas Schmedtmann**. The main purpose of this project is to practice and demonstrate core JavaScript concepts through a hands-on, interactive application.

While the overall idea and base UI/design are inspired by the course material, the focus of this repository is on understanding and implementing JavaScript logic rather than original visual design.
